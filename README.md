In this project I will write some basic HTML code that realizes a recipe website, as part of the HTML foundations course in The Odin Project. Once this project is complete I would have demonstrated a good grasp of the concepts learned throughout TOP to this point, including text in HTML, lists, links, images etc.
In order to use as much of the learned tools as possible I will deliberately use different ways to achieve the same goal in the HTML code, for example some of the images in the web pages will be sourced with relative links and some with absolute links.
