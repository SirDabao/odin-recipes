    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This page contains the recipe for a simple pizza margherita .<br>
        Acquire the ingredients and follow the steps listed below in order to make a pizza of your own</p>
        <p>Also, it is optional (and recommended) to add some of your favorite toppings onto the pizza before putting it in the oven!</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the base:</strong> Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt.
            Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft,
            fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.
            Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like,
            but it's not essential for a thin crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together,
            then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll out the dough:</strong>  if you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, 
            then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, 
            using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven.
            Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li><strong>Top and bake:</strong> heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8.
            Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf.
            Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, 
            drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray.
            Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using.
            Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
    </ol>
